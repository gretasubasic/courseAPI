# Course API

This is a sample CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Spring Boot. The application uses Spring Data JPA to interact with a PostgreSQL database and includes Spring Security for secure user authentication and authorization.

The purpose of this project is to showcase a fully functional CRUD application developed with Spring Boot. The application allows users to manage resources via RESTful endpoints, perform database operations, and ensure data security through user authentication and authorization.
